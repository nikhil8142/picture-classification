Object detection is an important task in computer vision that involves identifying and locating objects in images. This study introduces a new method for detecting objects using deep learning, specifically Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). The proposed model improves detection accuracy by extracting features at different scales and refining object boundaries using a technique called non-maximum suppression. The model is trained on a specific dataset to improve its performance. Tests on popular benchmarks show that our model performs better than traditional methods, with faster and more accurate results. These findings suggest that deep learning-based object detection can be highly effective for real-time applications like self-driving cars, security cameras, and augmented reality.
